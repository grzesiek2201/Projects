The most recent project of mine. Along with a friend we're building a parallel delta robot. Based on arduino MEGA, nema17 stepper motors and AS5600 encoders.
It's opensource, so all files will eventually be shared here. So far we've ordered all the parts and are working our way into preparing models for printing.
