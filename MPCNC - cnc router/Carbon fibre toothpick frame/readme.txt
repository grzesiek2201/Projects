As one of my hobbies is flying and building FPV drones I often have to deal with broken frames. This frame is for a 65mm toothpick drone partly created and popularised by KababFPV.
After breaking a few frames I decided to strengthen the design a bit by increasing the cross-section in the motor mounting area and reducing screw holes to the minimum.
Milled with 2mm diameter multi-flute PCB endmill.
Remember to always mill carbon fiber in a water bath to reduce the carbon dust getting into the air. Always wear a mask and other proper PPE.
