MPCNC stand for Mostly Printed CNC. As the name suggests - it is mostly 3D printed.
I decided to build such a router to mill wood, carbon fiber and engrave various materials. Parts needed for this build are the same parts needed to build 3D printers and hobby CNC machines, which greatly reduced the cost of the build.
Overall the build is a success, the machine proved itself useful in various projects. It works very well in wood and carbon fiber, altough milling metals is problematic to say the least due to some flex in the gantry.
